|{jump here}|

Welcome to the real start of the WoC demo!

Right now, you've just jumped to a woc tag that has been defined at the start
of this file using the |{TAG}| syntax.

However, this is nothing new... so let's use the remote capabilities of WoC!
At this URL http://fenix.olocolors.org/~alpt/woc/ there is the full copy of
the WoC sources.

The tag {-rmtdemo/rmt/faraway-} , which is a short form of
{-http://fenix.olocolors.org/~alpt/woc/demo/rmt/faraway:-}
points to the tag ``faraway'' which is located in the specified remote
location. Jumping on it will cause woc to download the tags files of the
remote location, and open the file where the tag was defined.

``rmtdemo'' is an URL alias which has been defined inside ./index.woc.
(Take a look at it).


Jump on {-rmtdemo/rmt/faraway-} to continue.

If you don't have an Inet connection, than go here: {-rmt/faraway:"fj-}
(Note: this is a cheating! ;)
