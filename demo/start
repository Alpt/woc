Remember three things:

	1) everything like {-this-} is a WoC tag.

	2) You can jump on a tag by moving the cursor over it, and hitting
	   CTRL-]
	
	3) You can go back by hitting CTRL-T

Note: if you want to see what are the characters used in an highlighted text
      use the  :p  vim command.

That's all,
now let's start the demo: {-jump here-}
