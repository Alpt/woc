|{faraway}|

Hi there,
I suppose you've come here after jumping on something like this:
{-rmtdemo/rmt/faraway-}.

Right now you're in a remote location, thus all the tag references you'll find
here are relative to this remote place.

For example, jumping on {-omega:0-}, will take you to the definition of omega
inside this current remote location (thus you'll download another file).

Note that the ':0' command will be executed right after the jump.
To know more, jump on {-omega:0-}

Again if you don't have an Inet connection go here: {-.faraway2:"fj-}
