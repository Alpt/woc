|{woc-cscope}|

Well, well, well... this was one of the main reasons why WoC was developed: using
cscope remotely.

(Note: you're still in a remote location, try using the {-:!pwd-} vicmd to know
where you are)

Inside this remote location there are three C programs. Suppose we want to 
define a jump on the definition of the main() function. We just have 
to write: {-main-}
Try jumping on it and come back.

If we want to reference all the functions calling fopen: {-fopen:"c-}
Similarly, let's see all the functions called by {-main:"d-}

The "d and "c commands are not a Vi-cmd, they are a TagCmd.

Use {-:Woctags help-} to get their complete list. then go to {-../tagcmds-}.
