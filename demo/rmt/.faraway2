Let's talk about Vim commands.

It is possible to specify a VIM command to be executed, right after the jump.
For example: {-omega:8-}
the above tag tells Vim to jump to the tag ``omega'' and then moving the
cursor at line 8 (this line!).
Or {-omega:/VIM-} tells Vim to go the the first occurence of the word
'VIM' after jumping on the definition of ``omega''.

Since you can specify even null tags, the following tag reference is valid:
	
		   {-:/[G]ur/ | exe 'normal yy@"' | w "-}

Try it! 
(even if you don't have an Inet connection)

:.! echo 'Gur frperg whzc vf: {-.frperg:"sw-}' | tr A-Za-z N-ZA-Mn-za-m


We'll now explore the cscope commands.
If you don't have cscope installed INSTALL IT RIGHT NOW:
{-:! lynx http\://cscope.sourceforge.net/-}
When you feel ready go here: {-code/woc-cscope-} 

If you don't care, then go to learn the {-tagcmds-}
