1.2

Fixed a ``wocdownloader'' bug.

Added the g:woc_global_index option. It specifies to always load a global
index.woc file.

Python syntax highlighting

When WOCClearCache() is called automatically by WOC, only the last used cache
is cleaned. If, instead, it is called by the :WocClearCache user command, the
whole cache/ dir is removed.

Added the g:woc_mappings option, to let the user define more easily its own
mappings.

1.1

Added a little bit of documentation.
