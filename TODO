- |{TODO wocpath}|

   ~/.vim/woc/ is used as an hardcoded path only in some places.
   These are the places where it is referenced in an hardcoded 
   form: {-TODO wocpath:"r-} 

   The other places just use {-WOC_HOME-}

- See {-TODO generic downloader-}

- Mouse support

- |{TODO mouse support}|

   How is it possible to get the position of the clicked point?
   I don't know. If something like getmousepos(), then it's possible to nmap
   these:

	nmap <C-LeftMouse>  :call <SID>WOCMouseTagCmd()<cr>
	nmap g<LeftMouse>  :call <SID>WOCMouseTagCmd()<cr>

   Where WOCMouseTagCmd() uses getmousepos() instead of getpos()

- Use all the options defined in {-dev/index.woc:"fj-}
  Right now, only the aliases are used.

- {-woctags.sh:"fj-} has a regexp bug:
	{-tagref1-} bla bla {-tagref2-}

  is parsed as: 'tagref1-} bla bla {-tagref2'
  and not as two different tags 'tagref1' and 'tagref2'.

- Support an embedde form of index.woc: it should be possible to specify the
  aliases inside the current text file.
